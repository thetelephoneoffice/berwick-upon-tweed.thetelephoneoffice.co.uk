    <h1>Berwick Telephone Exchange: A Historical Overview</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The first telephone exchange in Berwick-Upon-Tweed was opened in 1894 by the National Telephone Company in the attic of No 5 Hide Hill. Twelve years later, a new post office was built in Woolmarket with space for a telephone exchange. When the General Post Office (GPO) took over the company system in 1912, the exchange was moved there.</p>

    <p>Today, the Berwick Exchange serves approximately 6,430 residential premises and 542 non-residential premises. It provides ADSL broadband services and has been enabled for ADSL Max since 2006. The exchange also offers FTTC and FTTP services in some areas.</p>
